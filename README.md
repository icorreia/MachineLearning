Machine Learning
===============

Own implementations of ML algorithms for learning proposes.

The structure of the repository goes as follows:

    1. The main folder will contain subfolders for all the implemented algorithms.
    2. Every subfolder has a 'code' folder with the actual implementation, while the 'validation' folder has everything needed to validate the implementation. This includes datasets and what other implementations were used to make the validation.
